# default_arguments_in_the_middle.txt

This code will raise a syntax error. The documentation says that arguments with default values need
to be gropued together; I assume that means they need to be on either end and not in the middle
(though this is not stated excplicitly).

If this syntax IS allowed, this code should print:
[4, 5, 3, 6]
